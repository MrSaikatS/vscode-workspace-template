# VSCode Workspace Template

Use this template to set up a fresh Visual Studio Code workspace in a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

- You already have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed.
- You are using Windows. If you use another system, change the font install steps to match your OS.

## Why use this template

- **Clean font**: the JetBrains Mono Nerd Font gives you ligatures and symbols that look great in code and the terminal.
- **Helpful defaults**: tabs, formatting, and Tailwind CSS support are already turned on.
- **Faster setup**: the recommended extensions give you linting, Prisma tools, better errors, and more with one click.

## What is inside

- `.vscode/extensions.json`: suggested extensions for this setup
- `JetBrainsMonoNerdFont-Regular.ttf`: programming font used in the settings
- `settings-template.json`: ready-to-copy VSCode user settings

## How to set up

1. **Install the font**: open `JetBrainsMonoNerdFont-Regular.ttf`, right-click, choose "Show more options", then pick "Install for all users".
2. **Install the extensions**: in VSCode open the Extensions view (`Ctrl + Shift + X`), type `@recommended`, and install each item with the cloud icon.
3. **Copy the settings**: open `settings-template.json`, copy everything, then in VSCode press `Ctrl + Shift + P`, run "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)", delete existing text, and paste the copied content.
4. **Reload VSCode**: press `Ctrl + Shift + P`, run "Developer: Reload Window", and you are ready to code.

## Adjust the settings if needed

- If you already had personal settings, save a copy before pasting the template so you can bring back anything you missed.
- After the reload, tweak values like zoom level or terminal shell if you prefer something else.

## Check everything works

- Open a file and confirm the font changed in the editor and terminal.
- Create a quick file and save it to make sure Prettier formats it without errors.
- Type Tailwind classes in a file and confirm you see autocompletion.
